# Elm development template
This is a template used at COYA AG to develop Elm based applications.

## Why?
Elm reactor is a really nice tool, but we need some developer `opinionated` utilities, like liverload, configuration files and cli scripts.

## How?
We have a custom `bin/` directory with different yarn tasks to run: servers, tests, builds and deploys. Them can be found in the `pakage.json` under the `scripts` section.

## Installation
Run `yarn install`


## Usage
Run `yarn run scriptName` for example: `yarn run server`
